§ Golang

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux  

The **Go programming language**, also known as **golang**, is a [[programming-language]] that had its start in the year 2007 but first appeared in the year 2009.

The **Go programming language** has syntax similar to the //AWK programming-language//, the //C programming-language//, the //C++ programming-language//, the //C# programming-language//, the //Dart programming-language//, the //Java programming language//, the //JavaScript programming language//, the //Perl programming-language//, the //PHP programming//, the //Ruby programming-language//, the //Rust programming-language//, the //Swift programming-language//, the //V programming-language//, and others in C-family of programming-languages.

The **Go programming language** was influenced the //APL programming-language//, the //C programming-language//, the //Oberon-2 programming-language//, the //Pascal programming-language//, the //Modula programming-language//, the //Modula-2 programming-language//, and others.

§§ Hello World

A simple [[hello world]] program in **golang** looks like this:

 package main
 
 import "fmt"
 
 func main() {
 	fmt.Println("Hello world!")
 }

I have been programming in the **Go programming language** (**golang**) since **March 13, 2013**.
